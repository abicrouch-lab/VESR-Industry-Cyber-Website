            <ol>
                <li> I believe in being honest and being consistent in my actions. I strive to have strong morals everyday and will always take responsibility for my actions. </li>
                <li> As I grew up my family taught me to always do the right thing, even when it's difficult. My family is big on being trustworthy to each other and supporting one another. </li>
                <li> It's important to me to have integrity because it builds trust with others and helps me stay true to my values. </li>
                <li> If people cannot trust me, then I cannot build meaningful relationships with them. This goes for everyone too. People could lose friendships or jobs that could cost them. </li>
            </ol>

        <h2> Hard Work </h2>
        <ol>

        </ol>

        <h2> Growth </h2>
        <ol>

            <li> My family has always encouraged me to pursue my interests and try new things. They believe that growth comes from stepping out of my comfort zone and embracing change. </li>
            <li> Growth is important to me because it helps me become a better version of myself and adapt to the ever-changing world around me. </li>
            <li> If people do not focus on growth, they may become stagnant and miss out on opportunities for personal and professional development. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2> Family </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> I value the support and love of my family. They are my foundation and provide me with the strength to pursue my goals. </li>
